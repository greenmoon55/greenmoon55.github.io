寒假在家看超级碗广告的时候发现的这个 iPad 广告，太赞了，吸引我把[电影](http://movie.douban.com/subject/1291548/)也看了，电影有点“痛斥美国教育”的感觉...里面的诗写得真好。

> We don't read and write poetry because it's cute. We read and write poetry because we are **members of the human race**. And the human race is filled with passion. And medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, **these are what we stay alive for**.

> To quote from Whitman, "O me! O life!... of the questions of these recurring; of the endless trains of the faithless... of cities filled with the foolish; what good amid these, O me, O life?" Answer. That you are here - that life exists, and identity; that the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse. That the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse. What will your verse be?
